Here is my expperience/process of making two Tomcats (Tom1 and Tom2) running on Windows:

Setup Tomcat according to http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Tomcat_HowTo.html

However, Tom1 starts up fine, but not Tom2.

So in addition to the above, in server.xml, make/change the following (on Tomcat 6.0.44, JDK 1.6.0_45):

Line 22: Tom1 shutdown port = 9001
Line 22: Tom2 shutdown port = 9002

Line 53: Tom1 service name = "Catalina1"
Line 53: Tom2 service name = "Catalina2"

Line 69: Tom1 connector (http) = 9001
Line 69: Tom2 connector (http) = 9002

Line 71: Tom1 redirect port = 8443
Line 71: Tom2 redirect port = 8444

Line 90: Tom1 connector (ajp) = 8009
Line 90: Tom1 redirect = 8443
Line 90: Tom2 connector (ajp) = 8010
Line 90: Tom2 redirect = 8444

Line 102: Tom1 engine name = "Catalina1"
Line 102: Tom2 engine name = "Catalina2"

Starting up each server
